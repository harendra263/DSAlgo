'''    
Time complexity: O(9^(n*n)). For every unassigned index, there are 9 possible options so the time complexity is O(9^(n*n)). The time complexity remains the same but checking if a number is safe to use is much faster, O(1).
Space Complexity: O(n*n). As in worst case there can be n*n "." so to update them in board we need to use this space.
